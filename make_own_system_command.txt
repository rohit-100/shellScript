first make the shell script
the the file any of the dir which location is stored int $PATH variable
you can do it with
export PATH=${PATH}:path_to_be_added
but this one is temprory only


to make it permanant you have to define the same thing in ~/.bash_profile

PATH=$PATH:paths_to_be_added
export $PATH


or export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
