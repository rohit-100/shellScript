default value is blank for any shell variable

if we define any varibale then we will get a value

some are system defined variables or enviroment variables like $USER $SHELL $PATH


how can we see all sys varibale 
use command    env or printenv or set 
always sys defined variables are in capital letter

$? gives the status of priviously executed command
if val is zero then the priviously executed command succesfuuly 
else execution failed;
